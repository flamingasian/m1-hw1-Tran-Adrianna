# My First Coding Assignment #
![Neverending Bullshit](/Assets/Neverending.jpg)
## About Me ##
As a born and raised Floridian, I can proudly say that I have held a gator, attended hurricane parties, gone to the beach every summer and most of all, attended the best school in Florida (Florida State University, of course). I am not good at volleyball, dancing, or video games but I like them all nonetheless. Things I don't like include refried beans, the Beatles, cockroaches, and the City of Miami. 
## Past Coding Experience ##
I took one coding class for two months in middle school before I transferred schools. One time, I did an internship with a realtor and coded their MLS onto their website which I created on SquareSpace. That is all. 
## Career Goals ##
1. When I was little, I wanted to be a PowerPuff Girl. 
2. Now, I am being severely underpaid working for the Florida Legislature and I can't even fly. Bummer.
3. My boss just lost her primary for State Senate so now I have to find a new job.
4. I want to the gain the knowledge and experience that will make me marketable to employers and formidable to my foes and competition.
5. Maybe one day, I can have a job with benefits AND a living wage. Maybe I'll find that after I finish this grad program. 
6. Retire before 75?
